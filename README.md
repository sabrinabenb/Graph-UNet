# Graph-UNet
new version of graph UNets
In this work we combine several innovative elements to
boost its effectiveness. It utilizes data enrichment methods to compensate
for incomplete data, refined optimization approaches to improve learning efficiency,
and targeted regularization strategies to address common GNN limitations.
These elements work in concert to overcome fundamental challenges
in graph representation learning while maintaining scalability across various
graph sizes and types
